              "I had a chance to work with Christofer Piedra during his tenure at Tecore Research Lab, during which he contributed much,
              especially in the DoD project on setting up a Linux-based Intrusion Detection System, or simply IDS.
              <br />
              <br />
              Christofer is an extremely hardworking and dedicated professional who does much more than what is normally expected of him.
              Indeed, integrity and dependability shone through in all of the projects that he was working on. Taking responsibility was
              exceptionally well carried out; he delivered results while he kept integrity at its highest level.
              <br />
              <br />
              What definitely sets Christofer apart is that he has great technical acumen, full of attention to detail with regard to Linux
              environments. He was instrumental in the success of our IDS project by applying his deep knowledge of system security and network
              defenses. His work ethic and commitment made him an invaluable asset within our team, and he could always be counted on to provide
              innovative solutions.
              <br />
              <br />
              I do not doubt that Christofer's abilities and commitment will continue to make a positive impact wherever he goes. Therefore, I
              strongly recommend him to any organization that needs a responsible, honest, hardworking employee, and a team player.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sincerely,

              "I had the pleasure of working alongside Christofer Piedra during his time at Florida Atlantic University. Christofer is an
              exceptionally talented individual with a strong foundation in software development, network security, and data analysis. His
              hands-on experience, particularly with Node.js and Python, has been instrumental in the success of various projects, including his
              contributions to the Testbed for the Tecore Lab.
              <br />
              <br />
              What truly sets Christofer apart is his unique blend of technical expertise and business acumen. He understands how to leverage
              technology to drive business outcomes, making him a valuable asset in any project. His ability to communicate complex technical
              concepts clearly to non-technical stakeholders demonstrates his strong interpersonal skills and strategic mindset.
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition to his technical skills, Christoferâ€™s commitment to continuous learning and innovation is commendable. He approaches
              challenges with a problem-solving attitude and consistently seeks effective solutions. I wholeheartedly recommend Christofer for any
              opportunity that requires a dedicated, skilled, and business-savvy team player."
